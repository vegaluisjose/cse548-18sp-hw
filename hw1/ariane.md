# Ariane

## Docker setup

If you have not built the Docker image please read [this](https://github.com/vegaluisjose/cse548-18sp-hw/tree/master/setup)

## Download and build [Ariane](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ariane)

* Run `make target=ariane`

Ariane is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit
RISC-V instruction set. The goal of this step is to download the
RTL-implementation and generate a binary for simulation.


## Download, build, and run [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) for Ariane

* Download and build riscv-tests by `make target=rvtests`
* Run a test by `make target=run_test`
    * Change a benchmark by changing the [test](https://github.com/vegaluisjose/cse548-18sp-hw/blob/master/hw1/Makefile#L3) variable
* Other compiled benchmark tests can be found in `ls ./out/rvtests/share/riscv-tests/benchmarks`
* Other compiled isa tests can be found in `ls ./out/rvtests/share/riscv-tests/isa`

## Building and running a [hello-world](https://github.com/vegaluisjose/cse548-18sp-hw/blob/master/hw1/src/hello.c) program in Ariane
    
* Build `make target=hello`
* Run `make target=run_hello`
